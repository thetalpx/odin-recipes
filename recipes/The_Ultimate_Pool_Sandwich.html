    <h1>How to Make The Ultimate Pool Sandwich</h1>

    <p>You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make The Ultimate Pool Sandwich: </p>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you’re making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top. </li>
        <li>Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there’s no waste.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well. </li>
        <li>Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and top; place loaf and top on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with reserved bread top.</li>
        <li>Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it down.</li>
        <li>Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular sections.</li>

    </ol>
